BSN Yan'an Chain is an authoritative application governance chain. It is used to provide distributed applications deployed by authoritative institutions for public services. Several pilot applications have been deployed and are managed by the State Information Center, the First Research Institute of the Ministry of Public Security, Cloud Computing and Big Data Research Institute of the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, China Mobile Group Design Institute, and the BSN Development Association.

BSN Yan'an Chainis built on the BSN-DDC Network, maintaining consistency with other Open Permissioned Blockchains in terms of openness and transparency. Any institution, enterprise, or individual user can easily and quickly access the chain and call the services provided by the official applications, but they cannot directly deploy any third-party applications on Yan'an Chain.
